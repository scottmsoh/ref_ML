### NLP Basic steps</br>

1. Data Collection:
Gather a relevant dataset. This data might be in the form of text documents, web pages, emails, social media posts, etc.</br>
Ensure the dataset is large and diverse enough to train models effectively for the task at hand.</br>

2. Data Preprocessing:</br>
    1) Text Cleaning: Remove irrelevant characters, symbols, and formatting to simplify the text.</br>
    2) Normalization: Convert text to a consistent format (like lowercasing all letters).</br>
    3) Tokenization: Break text into smaller units (tokens), typically words or subwords.</br>
    4) Stop Words Removal: Eliminate common words (like "the", "is", "in") that don't            contribute much to the meaning of the text.</br>
    5) Stemming and Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.</br>

3. Feature Extraction:</br>
Convert text data into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand.
Techniques include Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and word embeddings (like Word2Vec or GloVe).</br>

4. Model Selection and Training:</br>
Choose a machine learning model appropriate for the NLP task. This could be traditional models like Naive Bayes, SVM, or more advanced deep learning models like RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers. Train the model on the preprocessed and vectorized text data.</br>

5. Evaluation:</br>
Test the model on a separate validation dataset to evaluate its performance.</br>
Common metrics for evaluation include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., depending on the specific task.</br>

6. Fine-Tuning and Optimization:</br>
Adjust model parameters, fine-tune hyperparameters, or use techniques like cross-validation to improve performance.</br>

7. Deployment:</br>
Integrate the model into an application or system.</br>
Deploy the model for real-world use, often involving serving the model through an API.</br>

8. Post-Deployment Monitoring and Updating:</br>
Continuously monitor the model's performance in the real world.</br>
Update the model with new data or retrain it to maintain or improve accuracy.</br>

9. Scaling and Maintenance:</br>
Ensure the model can handle increased loads and data variability.</br>
Maintain the system, fixing any issues and updating it as necessary.</br>


NLP applications can include tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, speech recognition, chatbots, text summarization, and information extraction. Each application might require specific adjustments or additional steps in the NLP pipeline.

--------------------------------------------

1. Tokenization:</br>
    Tokenization deals with the form of the text (turning text into numbers)</br>
2. Word2Vec:</br>
    Word2Vec deals with the meaning and relationships of words within a high-dimensional vector space.</br>
