### AB Test result verification</br>

1. Perform Statistical Significance Testing:</br> 
Use t-test or chi-squared test, to determine if the observed differences are statistically significant. This involves calculating a p-value, which tells you the probability of observing the results you got (or more extreme) if there were actually no difference between the groups</br>

2. Evaluate the Results:</br>
If the p-value is below a predetermined threshold (commonly 0.05), the result is considered statistically significant</br>

3. Consider Practical Significance:</br> 
Even if a result is statistically significant, it may not be practically significant. For example, a very small improvement in conversion rate might not justify the cost or effort of implementing a change.</br>

4. Review Other Metrics:</br> 
Look at secondary metrics as well to ensure that the change didn’t negatively impact other important aspects of the user experience.</br>

5. Make Decisions Based on Results:</br> 
If the results are statistically and practically significant, you might choose to implement the change. If they’re not, you might stick with the original version or explore other modifications.</br>
