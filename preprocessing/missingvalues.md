### Deal with missing values


1. Median Imputation
2. Mean Imputation
3. Zero Imputation
4. Mode Imputation: For categorical data, replacing missing values with the mode (the most frequent category).
5. Forward or Backward Fill: In time series data, forward fill (use the previous value) or backward fill (use the next value) can be used.
6. Predictive Models: Using algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors, linear regression, or decision trees to predict and impute missing values based on other features in the data.
7. Data Deletion: In cases where the proportion of missing data is minimal, rows with missing data might be dropped. This is generally not recommended unless the amount of missing data is very small.
