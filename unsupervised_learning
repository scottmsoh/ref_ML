Unsupervised-learning methods

1. Clustering: This is the process of grouping data points or objects in such a way that objects in the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Examples of clustering algorithms include K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.
2. Association: This type of unsupervised learning is about discovering rules that describe parts of your data. For example, in market basket analysis, it might uncover that customers who buy product A often also buy product B.
3. Anomaly Detection: This involves identifying unusual data points in your datasets. For example, detecting fraudulent transactions in banking.
