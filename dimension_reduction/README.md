1. Demension Reduction = Feature extraction</br>
  1) PCA (Principle Component Analysis)</br>
      To remove overfitting, improve performance
      Only linear cases</br>
      Large dataset fine
      Unsupervised
     
  3) LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)</br>
      Useful for classification cases</br>
      have labeled data and are interested in maximizing class separability and minimizing variance inner class</br>
      Large dataset fine</br>
      Supervised

  5) t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)</br>
      High dimensional cases</br>
      Prefer to use small dataset</br>
      When you have complex, nonlinear data structures.</br>
      Computationally expensive, especially on large datasets.</br>
      The results can be sensitive to hyperparameter settings.</br>
      high-dimensional data, datasets with complex, nonlinear structures.</br>
