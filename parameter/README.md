### Parameters & Hyper parameters

Model parameters (coefficients and intercept, which the model learns from the data) </br></br>
Hyperparameters (settings or configurations for model training)</br></br>

Both are crucial in model setup and training, but they play different roles</br></br> Hyperparameters are set before training and control the behavior of the training process</br> while the model parameters are the outcomes of the training process</br>
