### Parameters & Hyper parameters

1. Model parameters (coefficients and intercept, which the model learns from the data) </br>
2. Hyperparameters (settings or configurations for model training)</br>
Both are crucial in model setup and training, but they play different roles</br></br>

#### Hyperparameters: set before training and control the behavior of the training process</br> 
#### Model parameters: the outcomes of the training process</br>
